# Setting up the Project

First you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the package manager
that comes with it: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Once you've got that working, head to the command line where we'll set
up our project.

## Clone the Tutorial

```
git clone <tutorial url>
cd react-router-tutorial
git checkout start
npm start
```

Now open up http://localhost:8080

Feel free to poke around the code to see how we're using webpack and npm
scripts to run the app.

You should see a "Hello React Router" message in the browser.

## Make Some Changes

Open up `modules/App.js` and change the text to something like "Hello
<your name>". The browser automatically reloads with your new code.
